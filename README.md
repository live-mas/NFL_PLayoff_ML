Abstract— Data classification is a critical application to solving real world problems. This data project demonstrates how the machine learning method of logistic regression can predict whether an individual NFL can qualify for the playoffs using the metric known as Defense-adjusted Value Over Average (DVOA). The collected DVOA metrics are inputted as features into the logistic regression model to perform data classification for prediction. The Logistic regression model produced a prediction score of 0.83. 
Method - For this research project, team statistics will be used as features to predict whether that team will qualify for the playoffs. The metric that this project uses to evaluate a team’s overall performance is known as Defense-adjusted Value Over Average (DVOA). The DVOA metric is solely collected and calculated by the organization, Football Outsiders. The Football Outsiders break down each individual team’s performance by, “break[ing] down the entire season play-by-play, comparing success on each play to the league average based on a number of variables including down, distance, location on field, current score gap, quarter, and opponent quality.”
